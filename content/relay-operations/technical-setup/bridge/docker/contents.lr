We are maintaining a docker container that allows you to quickly set up an obfs4 bridge. First, fetch the container:

`docker pull phwinter/obfs4-bridge:latest`

Now, it's time to run the container.  We maintain a script that automatically determines a free OR and obfs4 port for you. The script only requires your email address as argument:
   ```
   $ curl https://dip.torproject.org/torproject/anti-censorship/docker-obfs4-bridge/raw/master/deploy-container.sh > deploy-container.sh
   $ bash deploy-container.sh address@email.com
   ```

That's it! Your container should now be bootstrapping your new obfs4 Tor bridge.
Make sure to check out the [post-install
notes](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/bridge/post-install/).  If
you are having trouble setting up your bridge, have a look at [our help
section](https://community.torproject.org/relay/getting-help/).
